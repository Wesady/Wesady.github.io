I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student at the [Institute of Systems Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences](https://www.ismsz.cn/Web/Default), advised by [Prof. Aiping Wu (吴爱平)](https://www.ismsz.cn/Web/KXYJKYTDPage?Id=31&PageId=283). My research focuses on computational biology, particularly on large language models for genomics. I received my Bachelor's Degree in Traditional Chinese Pharmacy from [Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine](www.njucm.edu.cn).
